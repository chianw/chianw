2. What are Administrative Units in Azure AD? Description [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/administrative-units)

3. In order to add your own custom domain name to AzureAD so that you do not use the default "onmicrosoft.com" domain, you must first own a domain and then you add it to Azure AD. Upon adding the custom domain that you own to AzureAD, you will need to add a TXT file to your registrar that owns your domain configuration.
