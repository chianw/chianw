## Enabling logging for NSX-T IDPS

In this post, I'm documenting how you can enable logging when NSX-T distributed IDPS is configured in NSX-T 3.1. Many people will think that just by toggling the "Logging" button to "enable" in an IDPS rule is sufficient, but as of NSX-T 3.1 there's still an additional step to enable the logging via a RESTful API call to NSX-T manager. 

**Step 1** - first enable logging for the specific distributed IDPS rule in NSX-T manager via NSX-T manager web interface

**Step 2** - Issue GET RESTful API call to NSX-T manager at the url <em>https://nsx-manager-fqdn/api/v1/global-configs/IdsGlobalConfig</em> . Note that **"global_idsevents_to_syslog_enabled"** will be initially set to false. Also take note of the revision number

**Step 3** - Issue PUT RESTful API call to the same URL above to set **"global_idsevents_to_syslog_enabled"** to true and make sure you use the **same revision number**. Use JSON for the body of the POST message.

**Step 4** - Verify that you see the logs on the ESXi hosts where IDPS events are triggered, see /var/log/nsx-idps/nsx-idps-events.log . The logs can be exported on EVE-JSON format to an external Syslog server. This configuration is done on ESXi host itself via vCenter

**NOTE** - if you do not perform steps 2 and 3, you will not get any logs even though you have enabled logging via webUI of NSX-T manager
