## Azure SQL Geo-replication

In this post, geo-replication of Azure SQL is being tested. An Azure SQL server is set up on Australia-East with 2 databases - geosqldb1 and TutorialDB. Only the TutorialDB database is replicated to another Azure SQL server in Japan East, but the geosqldb1 database is not replicated. 

> Note that replication is configured per-database. A SQL server can have multiple databases, and replication can be configured selectively for each database.


**1. Overview of setup - Azure SQL server and databases**

As setting up Azure SQL server is relatively straightforward, the step-by-step details of doing so are not shown for brevity. The below resources are all created in the same resource-group. The Azure SQL server in Australia East has 2 databases - geosqldb1 and TutorialDB. The Azure SQL server in Japan has the replicated instance of TutorialDB database, but not geosqldb1 which is not configured for geo-replication. To simplify testing, the database firewalls are configured to allow access from my public IP and basic user/password for SQL authentication is being used.

**2. Primary and Read-only replica**

As seen from the TutorialDB database in Australia East, it is the primary database with its read replica in Japan East

**3. Peform SQL query against the TutorialDB database in Australia East**

Using Azure Data Studio to connect to both the SQL servers in Australia East and Japan. For the TutorialDB in Australia East, it shows only 2 initial database entries in TutorialDB database.

Insert in another record into TutorialDB database in Australia East

**4. Read the replicated database in Japan**

The replicated database in Japan contains the updated table

**5. Attempt to update the TutorialDB database in Japan**

Attempting to update the TutorialDB database in Japan fails because it is read-only

**6. Trigger Azure SQL failover from Australia East to Japan by making SQL server in Japan the primary server**

After about 1 minute, the SQL server in Japan becomes the primary server with Australia East holding the read-only replica.

**7. Perform insert operation on TutorialDB database in Japan SQL server and observe replication to Australia East**  

Now that the SQL server in Japan is primary, it is now writable and hence we can insert a new record into TutorialDB database in Japan and observe the replication taking place to Australia

Insert new record into TutorialDB database in Japan

Verify that the record was successfully inserted

Verify that the record was successfully replicated to Australia by querying the TutorialDB database in Australia East

**8. Attempt to write to TutorialDB in Australia East is unsuccessful as it is read-only**  

Now that TutorialDB database in Australia East is read-only replica, any attempts to modify it directly will not be successful
